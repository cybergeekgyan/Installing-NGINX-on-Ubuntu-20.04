## What is Nginx?

Nginx is a Fast, Open Source, a high-performance web server that commands a huge market share in production environments. Nginx is one of the most popular web servers in the world and hosts some of the largest and highest-traffic sites on the internet. Nginx provides a content management cache, and a reverse proxy feature for HTTP and non-HTTP servers.

In this we will show you how to install, Services Manage, and Adjust Firewall.

### 1. Prerequisites

   * The operating system running Ubuntu 20.04 Linux
   * A root or non-root user with sudo privileges

To stop your web server, run this command:

    sudo systemctl stop nginx 

To start your web server, run this command:

    sudo systemctl start nginx

To reload your web server, run this command:

### 6. Nginx Adjusting Firewall

Check the available ufw application profiles:

    sudo ufw app list

Let’s enable the most restrictive profile that will still allow the traffic you’ve configured, permitting traffic on port 80:

    sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'

Verify the change:

    sudo ufw status

If you have other applications or services to allow, make sure you configure your firewall to allow traffic.

For example, using the sudo ufw allow 'OpenSSH' the command will enable secure, encrypted logins over the network.
